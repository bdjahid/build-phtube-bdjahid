            <h2>Qus: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.</h2>
            <p>Ans: While let and const are block-scoped, var declarations are either globally scoped or
                function-scoped. Let
                variables can be updated but not re-declared, const variables cannot be updated or re-declared, and var
                variables may both be updated and re-declared inside their scope.</p>

            <h2>Qus: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.</h2>
            <p>Ans: Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable
                which has been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has
                been declared, but its value has not been assigned.</p>

                transfer architectural style.
